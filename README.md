# Better Unlock Info

idk what to put here 

the jsons are put together by hand with data taken from GameManagers or from game directly, i didn't **write** anything by hand so it should be correct

wraith chest id is made up by me

### todo :
- likes on lvl (+ rate) progress bar (lazy tho so dont expect)

### ideas (maybe) :
- change buy popup to include `my colors` and icon name + number
- show somehow if someone is using 2.21 icons by icon hack
