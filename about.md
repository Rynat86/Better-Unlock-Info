## Notes / Known issues
- When equiping a icon though the Equip button the icons will update on your profile page after a game restart (I'm pretty sure it can be done instantly but idk how yet, will update if I found a way)
- When repeatedly opening more and more profiles the fps will drop
- To see how many friends you have in a friend unlock you need to open the popup twice
- I didnt really pay attention to spinoff games unlocks cuz i think it's still broken to merge saves, idk tho I could be wrong, same goes for ad chest unlocks
- The unlock progress bar doesn't currectly show up for creator related unlocks
- Buying animations in garage will show them as toggled on but they are actually off
- If a player didn't log in in 2.2 the glow color will show as green
